## Version 0.2.49

- Added an internationalization (i18n) framework to Thorium so it can be
  translated into other languages. Much thanks to
  [aBlueShadow](https://github.com/aBlueShadow) for spearheading this effort and
  providing initial German translations.
- Added a cooldown period on the alert condition changing buttons. This should
  keep anxious crew members from spamming alert condition changes. The cooldown
  is 5 seconds, but it resets every time the buttons are pushed, regardless of
  if it actually changes the alert condition.
- Made a few internal changes to ease the development process.

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue with the actions core where speak voices were not working.
  - Improved the layout of tactical maps again.
