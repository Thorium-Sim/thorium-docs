## Version 0.2.17

* Throttled the thrusters messages for better performance.
* Blocked some subscription updates to decrease the load on Core
* Made it possible to rename software panels
* Completed the sound engine, making it possible to play sound effects on any
  computer
* Added a special "Sound" client, which acts as a simulator-wide sound player
* Added a keyboard macro manager, which allows the flight director to perform
  macro actions with the press of a keyboard button. The intention for this
  feature is to operate like a sound keyboard, but it can also be used for
  effects. One example is playing a 'EMP' sound on all of the crew computers and
  simultaneously having their computers spark when the sound is played.
* Added the following macros:
  * Auto-advance - advance the timeline when this macro is run (must be used
    with delay to be effective)
  * Video-advance - advance the timeline when a video is done playing on the
    viewscreen
  * Play sound
  * Cancel all sounds
  * Set a timer on core (must have sync timer active)
* Add video previews to the mission script printing screen
* Sort printed timeline items by delay
* Add ship status viewscreen

* Issues resolved in this update:
