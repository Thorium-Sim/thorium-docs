## Version 0.2.24

* Fixed issues with damage steps
* Fixed issues with reactor power levels not being able to be set to 0
* Added efficiency labels next to the reactor control dropdowns
* Add ability to destroy systems. Right click on the system to turn it black.
* Timeline steps are now marked as 'Complete' when ran and are not executed
  again unless specifically requested. This does not apply to viewscreen
  timeline steps.
  * You can now use left and right arrow keys on the viewscreen station to
    change the timeline step back and forward. This is similar behavior to
    previous tactical stacks.
