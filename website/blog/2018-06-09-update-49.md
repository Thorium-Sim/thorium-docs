## Version 0.2.41

- Added the medical roster card. This card allows the medical officer to add
  information about the bridge crew so the bridge crew can be added as patients
  in the sickbay.
- Added the sickbay card. This card has reference to the bunks that are in the
  sickbay of the simulators. Patients can be assigned to the bunks. Once
  admitted, the doctor can check vitals, such as blood pressure, temperature,
  heart rate, and o2 levels (using actual medical equipment, if possible), list
  symptoms, get a diagnosis from the computer, and recieve treatment
  instructions from the core. They can also perform patient scans inside the
  bunk. (For internal medical scanning, using the security scanner card.)
