# Creating a New Frontend Card

This video shows a demonstration of creating a frontend card for a system.

Basically:

* Use the template card to link up to some mock data that you've created for the
  Test simulator.
* Map out how you want the card to look. Layout all of the controls with
  Reactstrap for consistency.
* Use the `client` to perform mutations.
* Use the `<Asset />` component to load assets with a specific asset key.
* Write the rest of the card using standard React and Webpack practices (eg. for
  loading static images and CSS)
