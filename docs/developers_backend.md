Basically:

* You sketch out the design to get a basic idea of what you will be creating and
  how the pieces interact
* You create GraphQL types schema for all the pieces
* You create a class with the same fields as the GraphQL type
* You create GraphQL schemas for queries, subscriptions, and mutations as needed
* You create GraphQL resolvers for the queries, subscriptions, mutations, and
  types as needed
* You create events for the mutations
* You can test your code with the GraphiQL developer tool
