title: Flight Directing Overview
---

The flight director is probably the most important person in a Thorium mission.
Without the Flight Director, nothing would happen. It is the flight director's
job to monitor the crew, update the simulation based on their actions, and drive
the storyline. The flight director is a professional storyteller.

The flight director will guide the mission through the following steps:

1.  [Mission briefing](/docs/fd_briefing.html)
2.  [Station Training](/docs/fd_training.html)
3.  [Acting](/docs/fd_acting.html)
4.  [Starting the Mission](/docs/fd_mission.html)
