Thorium is a platform for running starship simulations. The computer controls
simulate what the controls of a futuristic spaceship might be. These screens
control the engines, weapons, sensors, communications, and a host of other
things.

Why would you want something like this? To do a simulated space mission â€” in
space! These controls are part of a larger live-action roleplay experience which
anyone can do in the comfort of their homes or at a Space Edventure center. A
flight director controls the entire experience, acting like a game master for
the other participants. It's like a movie in real life where you are the actors!

Prior art includes [Empty Epsilon](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/) and
[Artemis](https://artemisspaceshipbridge.com), along with the host of other
starship controls which have been developed in the past for brick-and-mortar
Space Edventures centers.

## Space Edventures

What is a Space Edventure? Whereas Empty Epsilon and Artemis focus on short,
action-packed, entertaining simulations, Thorium is devoted to more methodical,
educational, dramatic simulations. We certainly hope you'll have a fun time
using Thorium, but its purpose is a little different:

* Give Flight Directors the tools they need to tell excellent stories and teach
  real principles.
* Give creators a platform for making new missions, simulators, and experiences.
* Give crews the opportunity to do hard things in a simulated environment.

Not convinced? Space Edventure simulations have been happening since 1990! These
videos might provide greater understanding of the use and power of Space
Edventures in education and entertainment.
