# Creating a Core Control

This video shows a demonstration of creating a new core control.

Basically:

* Make sure you have sufficient controls to control existing systems (there is
  typically no need to create systems on the core)
* Add it to a core layout so it is available for use
* Use the generic core components for consistency in the controls
* Use your card as a template for the core, if applicable.
