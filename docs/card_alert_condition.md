##Summary
The **Alert Condition** screen allows you to adjust the alert condition (similar to the DEFCON level) for the entire ship.

Alert conditions are easy ways of letting the entire crew know what the state of the ship is. When you change the alert condition, everyone on the ship will know.

To change Alert Conditions, simply click on the **Alert Condition** you want to go to. You can move your mouse over the condition to see a description in the **Alert Descriptions Box** of when the condition is applicable.
