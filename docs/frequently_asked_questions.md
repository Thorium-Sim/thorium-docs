## What are the best screen resolutions to run Thorium on?

Thorium was designed to run on 1600x900 resolution, but supports 1920x1080
resolution as well. You can also try 1366x768 resolution as well, but some
elements might not line up properly. 1024x768 resolution may also work, but
again - your milage may vary.
