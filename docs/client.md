While Thorium can run in any modern web browser, Thorium comes with a special
client application which can be installed on any computer you run a station on.
It allows for the following additional features:

* Automatic connection to a running Thorium server
* Station lockdown, keeping the crew from accessing other programs on the client
  computer
* Deeper system access, with support for remotely restarting, shutting down, or
  quitting the client computer
* Clients are automatically named the hostname of the computer

The client can be controlled with the following keyboard shortcuts:

* _cmd + option + q_: Quit the station
* _cmd + option + i_: Open the developer tools
* _cmd + option + k_: Exit kiosk mode
* _cmd + d_: Change the Thorium Server IP address

_Note: On Windows and Linux computers, replace the cmd key with ctrl_
