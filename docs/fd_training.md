title: Flight Directing: Training
---

Training makes a huge difference between a smooth mission and a rocky mission.
If the crew doesn't understand how to do their jobs, the entire mission will be
a challenge.

Thorium has built-in onscreen text training. Training begins with all of the
crew taking their places at their stations. The login screen has a 'Begin
Training' button which explains how the stations work and how to do the training
on all of their screens.

The flight director should give brief directions and encourage anyone who has
questions to ask. That means the flight director (and any support staff) should
know answers to most questions that the crew might have. Studying this
documentation can help learn the answers.

Once all of the crew has read through all of their training for each of their
screens, the mission can begin.
